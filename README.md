# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh\

## Think to do :

    - [] Create and display each component (5 components must be display)
    - [] Step's display must implement
    - [] Respect colors and typography
    - [] Make Responsive
    - [] Control form input

## Already done :

    - [x] create and display 4/5 component
    - [x] implement step's display
    - [x] Respect colors ans typography
